- Homer (Laura would've had to cross Ten Mile Creek at Homer)
- Shipman's Corners (known as St. Catharines downtown today. Note the search tool doesn't recognize the historical name)
- Power Glen (Another crossing of the Twelve Mile Creek and uphill climb)
- Decew House (Finally, Laura is escorted to Decew House by the natives to give her warning to Lt. Fitzgibbon)
